![.NET Core](https://github.com/SeanGiddings/CastleEscape/workflows/.NET%20Core/badge.svg)

This is just a test project so I can play around with .NET Core solutions, code organization, and GitHub actions.

Nothing to see here. Please move along and have a great day!

# Work in Progress

This documentation is a work-in-progress. The end goals are to help new C# developers:

* Create a .NET Core solution.
* Create at least 2 .NET Core projects and add them to the solution.
* Initialize a Git repo and get that on GitHub.
* Add a GitHub Actions workflow that will build their .NET Core solution on each commit/PR and run any unit tests that have been created.
* Add a status badge to their documentation so that anyone viewing or evaluating their work will be certain that the code will build on their computer.

If you would like to help, please feel free to fork this repository and submit a PR with your proposed changes. If you are unable to submit a PR, please submit an issue and I will take a look at it.

# Prerequisites

This document assumes you have done the following:
* Installed the .NET Core SDK (>= version 3.0)
* Installed Git
* Installed Visual Studio Code.

If you haven't done any one of these things, please take care of that before attempting to follow along here.

# Creating a Solution File

A solution file contains all of the code that supports your application. The solution file will allow you to manage multiple related projects as a single unit. This will often include the application itself ("CastleEscape") as well as unit tests ("CastleEscape.Tests") as well as other projects that are a part of your application. As an added bonus, the solution file will make opening the code in Visual Studio easier.

* Create a folder where ALL of your code will live. Ideally, it will be named for your project. (ex: "CastleEscape")
* Change in to that directory: `cd CastleEscape`
* Use the dotnet core CLI to create a solution file: `dotnet new sln`
  * This will create a file with the .sln extension (ex: "CastleEscape.sln")

* Alternative: You can make all three of the above steps happen at once with the following command: `dotnet new sln -n CastleEscape -o CastleEscape`. This will create a new dotnet solution file with the name "CastleEscape" and will place it in a new folder also called "CastleEscape".
  * -n tells dotnet to name the solution "CastleEscape"
  * -o tells dotnet to put the solution file in a folder called "CastleEscape".

# Creating New Projects

Your solution file will contain the project(s) that make up your application. For the sake of this demo, I am adding two projects - one for the console application and the other for unit testing.

* From inside of the solution directory (or workspace folder, whatever you want to call that) create a new console application project:
  `dotnet new console -n CastleEscape -o CastleEscape.`
  * -n stands for "name" tells dotnet to name the project "CastleEscape".
  * -o stands for "output" and tells dotnet to output that project into a folder called "CastleEscape".
* Add your new console application project to the solution: `dotnet sln add .\CastleEscape\CastleEscape.csproj` (tab completion will help here).
* Add your test project: `dotnet new xunit -n CastleEscape.Tests -o CastleEscape.Tests`
  * -n stands for "name" tells dotnet to name the project  "CastleEscape.Tests".
  * -o stands for "output" and tells dotnet to output that project into a folder called "CastleEscape.Tests".
* Add the test project to the solution: `dotnet sln add .\CastleEscape.Tests\CastleEscape.Tests.csproj`

# Getting Ready for GitHub

* Generate a .gitignore file so only necessary files are added to your repository: `dotnet new ignore` or `dotnet new gitignore`
* Initialize a new git repository in your solution directory: `git init`
* Get ready to save the work you have done by staging it for source control: `git add .`
* Commit the changes you have made so far: `git commit -m 'Initial commit'`
* On GitHub: Login and create a new repository called "CastleEscape".
  * Don't worry about using a Repository Template right now.
  * Make sure it is Public so others can see it.
  * Skip initializing the repository with a README.
  * Skip adding a .gitignore on GitHub. You've already done this.
  * Skip adding a license.
  * The next screen will show up with the title: "Quick Setup". Just below that, click on HTTPS and grab the URL for your repository. It will look something like `https://github.com/[Your_GitHub_Username]/CastleEscape.git`
* Go back to the terminal / command prompt.
* Add a remote repository so you can push your code to GitHub: (ex: `git remote add origin https://github.com/[Your_GitHub_Username]/CastleEscape.git`)
* Push the changes to GitHub: `git push -u origin master`
  * You only have to use `git push -u ...` once. This just tells git that you want to push changes upstream to the remote called origin from the branch called master. Once you have done this, you can just type `git push` to push future changesets to GitHub.

# Setting up .NET Core Build Actions in GitHub

* Go to your repository in GitHub (ex: https://github.com/[Your_GitHub_Username]/CastleEscape)
* Click on "Actions"
* GitHub will detect what kind of code you have in the repository and should suggest a .NET Core workflow.
* Click "Set up this workflow" to add this workflow to your project.
  * You will be forwarded to a new screen that shows you the contents of a file called "dotnetcore.yml". On the right hand side, you will see a button that says "Start commit". Click that.
  * In the first box that appears, give your commit a title. "Add workflow" should be sufficient.
  * There will be a second box where you can enter an extended description. "Add workflow" is sufficient there as well.
  * Make sure "Commit directly to the `master` branch" is checked.
  * Click "Commit new file". 
* Back in Visual Studio Code (or your terminal) type `git pull`. This will pull the changes that should have been committed to master when you added the .NET Core workflow. Specifically, you will see a new folder called ".github". Inside of that folder will be another folder called "workflows" which will contain a file named "dotnetcore.yml".
* Go back to GitHub and click Actions. When you click on the .NET Core workflow on the left hand side, you will see a button labeled "Create status badge" on the right hand side. Click that button and then the button labeled "Copy status badge Markdown". This will copy some Markdown to your clipboard.
* Create a new file in your solution's base directory called "README.md".
* Add the code you copied from GitHub in to this new file.
* Save your changes and then commit them:
  * In terminal, type: `git add .` to add the changes to your next commit.
  * Type: `git commit -m 'Adding status badge'`
  * Type: `git push`
* Go back to your repository in GitHub: (ex: https://github.com/[Your_GitHub_Username]/CastleEscape)
* Scroll down and you will see a status badge in the documentation below the files listed in your repository. If everything went according to plan, it will say ".NET Core" and then will show "passing" in green.

# Developer Workflow

This is the workflow I follow when working on small projects. I'm intentionally omitting the discussion of branching from master, making changes, and then submitting a pull request. For the purposes of this documentation, that discussion can wait until later.

1) `git pull`: To get the latest updates to the code base.
2) Make a small but complete set of changes.
3) Add unit tests (as needed).
4) `dotnet build`: Let's make sure the code builds. Do NOT commit broken code. If it won't build, consider using "stash" instead.
5) `dotnet test`: Assuming your project builds and you have written unit tests, now is a great time to run those tests. Do NOT commit code if the tests are broken.
6) `git add .`: Stage the changes I have made. Let's get them ready to go.
7) `git commit -m '[Your_Commit_Message]'`: Commit the changes locally. This defines the set of changes we are going to save.
    - Your commit message should briefly explain the work that was done in the commit.
8) `git push`: Push the changeset (commit) to GitHub (or whatever Git hosting service you are using).
9) Walk away. Take a short break away from the monitor. Breaks are important.
10) **Rinse and repeat**

# Notes

** Don't forget that it is OK to ask questions. Developers can't be expected to know or remember everything. **
